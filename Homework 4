1) select name from Highschooler, Friend where ID = ID1 AND ID2 IN (select ID from Highschooler where name = 'Gabriel'); 
2) select name, grade from Highschooler where NOT IN (select DISTINCT name from Likes a, Highschooler b where b.ID = a.ID1 OR b.ID = a.ID2); 
(A comment on number two: I ran the sub quarry by itslf. It gave me the inverse of the set I wanted. However, anytime I tried using the NOT IN operator on it the program wouldn't work.)
3) select a.name, a.grade, b.name, b.grade from Highschooler a, Highschooler b  where b.grade < a.grade-1; 
(The statement above gets all pairings of students with a two year difference.)
select h1.name, h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade from Likes l, Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2 where h1.ID = l.ID1 AND h2.ID = l.ID2; 
(The statement above gets all the Likes relationships.)
(I combined the statements into one larger statement using the IN operator. This didn't work because the rteturned table from the IF statement has two names and two grades.)

select a.name, a.grade, b.name, b.grade 
from Highschooler a, Highschooler b  
where b.grade < a.grade-1 
INTERSECT 
select h1.name, h1.grade, h2.name, h2.grade
from Likes l, Highschooler h1, Highschooler h2 
where h1.ID = l.ID1 AND h2.ID = l.ID2; 
(I feel like I'm onto something here. I'm gonna move on for time sake.)
